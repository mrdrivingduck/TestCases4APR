# TestCases4APR

All of the stack traces of failing test cases in [*Defects4J*](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j) are available at [`defects4j/failingtestcases/`](defects4j/failingtestcases/).

The FL results of *GZoltar* + *Ochiai* under different versions without/with our proposed principles are available at [`FL/original/`](FL/original/) (without principle) and [`FL/optimized/`](FL/optimized/) (with principle).

The patches generated by *AVATAR*, *TBar*, *SimFix* and *ACS* under the fault localization result optimized by our proposed principles are available in [`Patches/`](Patches/).

The source code to implement our proposed principles are available in [`FLOptimizer.java`](src/main/java/iot/zjt/floptimizer/FLOptimizer.java).
